        <p>I've been building websites and mobile applications since 2017 with a focus on good user experience and
          functionality. I
          am continuously learning and trying to master tools and technologies such as; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more
          to use in
          building better solutions to problems I come across in projects I work on.</p>
        <p>When I'm not working on projects or writing articles you can find me driving around the city of Los Santos
          and also
          spending time discovering new artists to listen to on Spotify.</p>
